# 0478-22-PRE-F-M-19
Solution of March 2019 pre-release material 22 for CAIE IGCSE Computer Science.
This is the solution I created and does not follow from the mark scheme.

## Important files
* `Pre-release Material Development.pdf` provides a detailed documentation.
* `0478-22-PRE-F-M-19 Task 3 1-2-3 Pseudocode.psu` is the full pseudocode.
* `0478-22-PRE-F-M-19 Task 3 1-2-3.py` is the full version of the Python 2.7 code.
* `0478-22-PRE-F-M-19 IDEAL.py` is the short version of my program (probably not acceptable by CAIE).

I created my own Pseudocode plug-in (Notepad++) specifically for my IGCSE and A Level courses. You can view it here: https://github.com/eccentricOrange/NPP-CAIE-Pseudocode-Highlighting-plugin
